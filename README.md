### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### Hello everyone! I am Michal, a sixth form student from Slovakia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°, living in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, studying Physics, Mathematics and (of course) Computer Science at A-Level.

Although most of my time spent on GitHub is generally spent working on my Computer Science NEA, I do still try and find time to work on personal projects, be it programming related, or doing things completely separate to my studies.


## More about me
As I mentioned above, I am a sixth form student in the UK, currently in the first year (Year 12) of my A-Level studies. Although I chose to study subjects which are considered very difficult, I have found my first year so far enjoyable overall.
I work part-time as a Lifeguard for a leading health and wellness group, and this - combined with my experiences in school and the Air Cadets - have proven extremely beneficial in developing key soft skills.

### Programming and my interests
Programming has been a hobby of mine since 2020, where I began my journey with Python Discord bots. From this humble beginning, I have raised the level of complexity of my code and focused on more and more demanding (and interesting!) projects to broaden and improve my abilities.
Below are some of the projects that I have worked on:
